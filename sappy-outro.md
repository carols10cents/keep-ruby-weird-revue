# Sappy Outro

Look, I'm up here, on stage, holding a puppet of myself, with two of my favorite people on this planet, each holding a puppet of themselves. This is an amazing moment, and we are so, so grateful to everyone that's made it possible.

Sharing moments with people is why we do this. Some, like this one, are amazing. Many others are ordinary, when measured by volume, and even those are pretty damn good. This is, as Sandi said, doing real things. And it'll keep us coming back to the keyboard, to the frustration, to the endless planning meetings, and the ever-changing tech landscape.

Jim Weirich passed away earlier this year. I, through putting on Steel City Ruby with Carol and lots of other awesome people in Pittsburgh, was fortunate enough to spend some time with Jim.

We shared a meal or two. We shared some jokes and even a hug. And, once, we shared a song. That was a pretty cool moment, in the hallway outside the conference hall on a hot August afternoon three years ago.

But there's a lot we didn't get to share. We never shared code, or ideas about code or our respective projects. We never shared a long cab ride to an airport, or our favorite brunch recipes. I never got to share with him all the weird shit I've made with Rake.

I guess what we're trying to say is that we want to share these moments with you. We don't want to miss another opportunity to let someone know the impact they've had on our lives. Maybe making a puppet that looks kinda like Aaron Patterson is a weird way to do it, but, hey, we're standing on the shoulders of giants, many of them pretty weird.

So thank you, again, for giving us a place to hang our hats. Thank you for keeping it weird, for optimizing for developer happiness, for being nice because Matz is nice, for all the pictures of your cats, and for never forgetting to test all the fucking time.
